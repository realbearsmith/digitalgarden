## What's a digital garden?

Well, it's this!

That's about all you can say for any digital garden. Simply put, it's one's own little corner of the internet, dedicated to helping them step out from artificial structures of thought and into the more organic, untamed wilderness.

Humans don't think in rows and columns. But our entire society has been built on spreadsheets in one form or another. This stripping away of context—this sterilization of thought limits our ability to think creatively and explore new boundaries.

The digital garden is an attempt to change that. It reintroduces the organic matter bleached away by our current platforms and encourages the writer to *get dirty*. While modern writing platforms focus more and more on removing obstacles to writing,[^1] the digital garden is an attempt to seek out new obstacles and learn new things in overcoming them.

Maybe that sounds pretentious, but it helps me think. And at the end of the day, this space is for me; not you.[^2}

## How's it different from a blog?

To be honest, there's probably no way for me to put it better than Maggie Appleton does [here](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history), but I'll try to summarize:

* While blogs are organized chronologically, digital gardens are organized topographically. They use bi-directional links to connect different notes based on contextual themes.
* While blog posts tend to be written once and likely not updated afterward, garden notes are consistently revisited and grown over time.
* Garden notes are intentionally imperfect. They have to grow over time, so the expectation is they won't be fully fleshed out. Appleton calls them "*the perfect balance of chaos and cultivation*," with *chaos* being streams like social media/private notes and *cultivation* being completed products like books and articles.
* Gardens are experimental; the heterogeneity of gardeners and their gardens results in unique configurations of thoughts, even if the content is the same. To this end, the very structure of a digital garden—its HTML structure, CSS styling, etc—is likely to change over time. Compare this to the likely "set it and forget it" layout of the modern blog.
* Digital gardens are content-diverse. They're more likely than blogs to contain a variety of content formats, from podcasts to code snippets.
* Gardens prioritize individual ownership. While it's hard to *truly* own a space of the internet in Web 2.0, digital gardens intentionally avoid storing thoughts on the servers of modern social media giants. This ensures that after the social media factory closes down and is demolished to make space for a competitor, the digital garden continues to grow.

Again, this is all a paraphrasing of Appleton's essay (which I highly encourage you read if this concept interests you),[^3], but it's what got me interested in this endeavor.

## Why?

While there are various different benefits of having a digital garden (like the aforementioned individual ownership), the greatest benefit in my eyes is ***serendipity***. 

Think back to a time you had a great idea—how did it happen? I wager it wasn't through deliberate planning toward finding this idea; that's not how most people think! 

The meme of the "aha moment" exists for a reason. Most of our best ideas come through serendipitous interactions, when certain neurons fire at the right moment in the right context, and a previously undiscovered thought is shoved to the forefront of our minds.

The main goal of a digital garden[^4] is to enable this ***serendipity*** by creating more opportunities for different thoughts to smack into each other, for contexts to collide, and for *ideas to have sex*.

[^1]: Don't get me wrong, this is admirable and useful!. Any effort to encourage more people to put their thinking on paper deserves praise and support. It's just not right for everyone.

[^2]: I do hope you get some value from it, though!

[^3]: Seriously, go read it.
