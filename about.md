# About Me

My name's Jared, but my loved ones call me Bear.

I currently manage research and reporting at [Primary Intelligence](https://www.primary-intel.com/), where I help sales teams in small businesses and Fortune 500 companies alike understand their buyers and competition.

In the past, I've worked on competitive political campaigns and in the California Senate.

I'm a serial amateur, and in my spare time I do research on topics including business leadership, political philosophy, voter data, and data visualization. I'm also passionate about music and learning new instruments, and am constantly working to expand my (rudimentary) knowledge of Python and frontend languages like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

I currently live in Boise, Idaho with my wife Minna and our Rottweiler (and mascot of this site), Mac.
